<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The main goal of this website is to improve the business and make it more known
to the public especially the younger audience. Today, technology is taking over and 
everyone is on the Internet. Hence, creating this site is a better choice than publishing
on newspapers. Customers can just browse through the website and enquire online instead
of having to walk-in to the shop.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p> Success will be evaluated by the number of enquiries received. There is a cosplay tutorial linked
via the first picture on the right hand side for those who are not aware what cosplay is.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The audience targeted is young people aged from 4-25. The website will have some pictures. </p>
